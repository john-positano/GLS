							title="Customer is uncomfortable using their card over the phone:"
							data-content="I can appreciate your discomfort using your card over the phone, but the main reason that we do bill through the card is simply because you are completely protected by your card company. You see (customer name), under a FEDERAL LAW called the CONSUMER FRAUD PROTECTION ACT, it states that if we or any other company billed something to your card without your approval or if we didn't send you exactly what we promised, your card company must protect you by allowing ou to dispute the charge. Now, if you did that, it would not only damage our excellent reputation as a company, but it could also cause us to lose our privilege to bill our customers through major Credit Cards. So, honestly, to charge something to your account without your approval would be extremely counterproductive. Remember, your only obligation is $1.95. So, what I need to do now is for you to verify the expiration date on the front of your card."

							data-content="We do enter all of your information into an encrypted system for your protection. Let me give you an example. You know when you go to an ATM machie and put in your ATM card? Instead of your pin number apearing on the screen, you just get a row of X&#39;s. This way, no one has access to your account number.Now, I do need to validate the exact month and year of the expiration of the credit card..."

This way, you can take advantage of the savings and make an informed decision on whether or not the program will benefit you.
